First Web Application assigned as coursework in a course @ Athens Tech College


An intro to Web Applications, where it was required with a team of co-students to select our own project idea and write a web app in **_php_ without using a framework**.

php template engine **_[twig](https://twig.symfony.com/)_** was used to implement Template inheritance & passing variables to rendered pages.

***

**Current functionality:**  

* Visitors can search for dive spots and check scheduled upcoming & past events on the calendar at home page.  
* Both **divers** & **dive centers** can signup through the sign up page.  
* Both users can upload photos to a Dive Spot, but uploading requires log in. Visitors are able to see already uploaded photos of the Dive Spot.  
* **Divers** can book their place in dive events, as long as the maximum amount of allowed participants of the event is not exceeded. They are able to see their history log of past & upcoming events.  
* **Dive centers** can create a dive event for a Dive Spot by setting required parameters such as maximum divers allowed, price, date, etc. They can check history log of their scheduled events too.  

_Improvements/Features to be done:_  

* Typing through search bar gets available Dive Spots by letters
* Create new Dive Spot for Diver or Dive Center
